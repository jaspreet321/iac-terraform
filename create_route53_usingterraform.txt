#zone_id: This specifies the ID of the Route 53 hosted zone in which the record should be created. It uses the zone_id attribute from an existing aws_route53_zone resource named "primary."

#name: This is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the record. In this case, it's "www.example.com."

#type: This specifies the type of DNS record. In this case, it's set to "A," which stands for Address record. This type is commonly used to map domain names to IPv4 addresses.

#ttl: This sets the time-to-live (TTL) for the DNS record. The TTL is the amount of time that DNS resolvers and caches should consider the record to be valid without checking for updates. Here, it's set to 300 seconds (5 minutes).

#records: This is an array of records associated with the DNS record. In this configuration, it's set to the public IP address of an Elastic IP (EIP) associated with an AWS Elastic Load Balancer (Elastic Load Balancing, or ELB). This implies that the "www.example.com" domain is being pointed to the specified public IP address.

#RECORD is basically the public IP address of load balancer, to reieve incoming request
